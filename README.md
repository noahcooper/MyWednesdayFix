MyWednesdayFix
==============

Version: 0.3 (08-NOV-2013)

MyWednesdayFix is an app currently under development. It will be available as a web app, and as a native app for iOS and Android devices.

The app is for comic book nerds by a comic book nerd. Its purpose is to provide said nerds with a look at new comic books in stores this Wednesday (or some other day this week for those odd books that go on sale on a Friday), as well as a look further into the future at books that are coming soon. It will also provide a simple way to lookup the closest comic book store in the nerd's area.

The app is built using:

 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for all sorts of JavaScript hackery
 * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for UI components
 * The [ComicVine API](http://comicvine.com/api) for book data
 * [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) for iOS and Android native apps
